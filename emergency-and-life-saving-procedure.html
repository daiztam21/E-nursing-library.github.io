						<h1>Emergency and Life-Saving Procedures</h1>

						<button class="accordion title" id="CPR">Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  <p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency treatment that's done when someone's
							breathing or heartbeat has stopped. For example, when someone has a heart attack or nearly
							drowns. CPR can help save a life.</p>
							<p>The American Heart Association recommends starting CPR by pushing hard and fast on the
							chest. The pushes are called compressions. This hands-only CPR recommendation is for both
							people without training and first responders.</p>
							<p>Here's CPR advice from the American Heart Association:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li> Not trained. If you're not trained in CPR or don't want to put your mouth on the person's
							  mouth or nose, then do hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest 100
							  to 120 times a minute. Do this until medical help arrives. Details are described below.
							  You don't need to place your mouth on the person's mouth or nose to give rescue breaths.</li>
							  <li> Trained and ready to go. If you're well trained and confident in your CPR ability, check
							  to see if there is a pulse and breathing. If there is no pulse or breathing within 10 seconds,
							  begin chest compressions. Start CPR with 30 chest compressions. Then give two rescue
							  breaths. Continue this pattern of chest compressions and rescue breaths until medical help
							  arrives.</li>
							  <li> Trained but out of practice. If you've previously received CPR training but you're not
							  confident in your abilities, then just do 100 to 120 chest compressions a minute. Details
							  are described below.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>!!The above advice applies to situations in which adults, children and infants need CPR, but not
							  newborns. Newborns are babies up to 4 weeks old.</b></p>

								<h3>When to seek emergency help</h3>
								<ul>
								  <li> If you are not trained but have immediate access to a phone, call 911 or your local
								  emergency number before beginning CPR. The dispatcher can tell you how to do CPR
								  until help arrives. To learn CPR properly, take an accredited first-aid training course. The
								  course should include instructions on CPR and use of an automated external defibrillator
								  (AED).</li>
								  <li> If you're afraid to do CPR or unsure how to do CPR correctly, know that it's always better
								  to try than to do nothing at all. The difference between doing something and doing
								  nothing could be someone's life.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Treatment</h3>
								<p>Before starting CPR, check:</p>
								<ul>
								  <li> Is the environment safe for the person?</li>
								  <li> Is the person conscious or not conscious?</li>
								  <li> If the person appears to be not conscious, tap or shake their shoulder and ask loudly, "Are
								  you OK?"</li>
								  <li> If the person doesn't respond and you're with someone else who can help, have one
								  person call 911 or the local emergency number and get an AED if one is available. Have
								  the other person begin CPR.</li>
								  <li> If you are alone and have immediate access to a phone, call 911 or your local emergency
								  number before starting CPR. Get an AED if one is available.</li>
								  <li> As soon as an AED is available, deliver one shock if instructed by the device. Then start
								  CPR.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Remember to spell C-A-B</h3>
								<p>The American Heart Association uses the letters C-A-B to help people remember the order to
								perform the steps of CPR.</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>C: compressions.</li>
								  <li>A: airway.</li>
								  <li>B: breathing.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Compressions: Restore blood flow</h3>
								<p>Compressions means you use your hands to push down hard and fast in a specific way on the
								person's chest. Compressions are the most important step in CPR. Follow these steps for
								performing CPR compressions.</p>
								<ol>
								  <li> Put the person on their back on a firm surface.</li>
								  <li> Place the lower palm of your hand over the center of the person's chest, between the
								  nipples.</li>
								  <li> Place your other hand on top of your first hand. Keep your elbows straight. Place
								  your shoulders directly above your hands</li>
								  <li> Push straight down on the chest at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) but no more than
								  2.4 inches (6 centimeters). Use your entire body weight, not just your arms, when
								  doing compressions.</li>
								  <li> Push hard and fast in the center of the chest. You want to do 100 to 120
								  compressions a minute. The American Heart Association suggests doing
								  compressions to the beat of the song "Stayin' Alive" or another song that has 100
								  to120 beats a minute. Allow the chest to spring back after each push.</li>
								  <li> If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue chest compressions until there are
								  signs of movement or until emergency medical help takes over. If you have been
								  trained in CPR, go on to rescue breathing.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>Airway: Open the airway</h3>
								<p>If you're trained in CPR and you've done 30 chest compressions, follow these steps to open the
								person's airway. This is called the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver.</p>
								<ol>
								  <li> Put your palm on the person's forehead.</li>
								  <li> Gently tilt the head back.</li>
								  <li> With the other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open the airway.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>Breathing: Breathe for the person</h3>
								<p>Rescue breathing can be mouth-to-mouth breathing or mouth-to-nose breathing if the mouth is
								seriously injured or can't be opened. Current recommendations suggest doing rescue breathing
								using a bag-mask device with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.</p>
								<p>Follow these steps after opening the airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver.</p>
								<ol>
								  <li> Pinch the nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing and cover the person's mouth
								  with yours, making a seal.</li>
								  <li> Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Give the first rescue breath — lasting one
								  second — and watch to see if the chest rises.</li>
								  <li> If the chest rises, give a second breath.</li>
								  <li> If the chest doesn't rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver. Then give a second
								  breath. Thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths is considered one
								  cycle. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force.</li>
								  <li> Continue chest compressions to restore blood flow.</li>
								  <li> As soon as an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, follow the
								  device's directions. Give one shock, then continue chest compressions for two more
								  minutes before giving a second shock. If you're not trained to use an AED, a 911
								  operator or another emergency medical operator may be able to tell you how to use
								  the device. If an AED isn't available, go to step 7 below.</li>
								  <li> Continue CPR until there are signs of movement or emergency medical help takes
								  over.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>To perform CPR on a child</h3>
								<p>The process for giving CPR to a child age 1 through puberty is essentially the same as that for an
								adult — follow the C-A-B steps. The American Heart Association says you should not delay
								CPR and offers this advice on how to perform CPR on a child:</p>
								<h3>Compressions: Restore blood flow</h3>
								<p>If you are alone and didn't see the child collapse, start chest compressions and continue for about
								two minutes. Then quickly call 911 or your local emergency number and get an AED if one is
								available.</p>
								<p>If you're alone and you did see the child collapse, call 911 or your local emergency number first.
								Then get an AED, if available, and start CPR. If another person is with you, have that person call
								for help and get the AED while you start CPR.</p>
								<ol>
								  <li> Place the child on their back on a firm surface.</li>
								  <li> Kneel next to the child.</li>
								  <li> Place two hands — or only one hand if the child is very small — on the lower half
								  of the child's breastbone.</li>
								  <li> Using the lower palm of one or both hands, press straight down on the chest about 2
								  inches (5 centimeters) but not greater than 2.4 inches (6 centimeters). Push hard and
								  fast — 100 to 120 compressions a minute.</li>
								  <li> If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue chest compressions until the child
								  moves or until emergency medical help takes over. If you have been trained in CPR,
								  open the airway and start rescue breathing.</li>
								</ol>

						<button class="accordion title" id="Defibrillation">Defibrillation and AED (Automated External Defibrillator) use</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p>An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a portable device that can be used to treat a person
							whose heart has suddenly stopped working. This condition is called sudden cardiac arrest.<br><br>
							AEDs are available in many public places, such as government buildings, schools, airports and
							other community spaces. Small, lightweight AEDs are available without a prescription for use at
							home.<br><br>
							People with severe heart disease who are at risk of sudden cardiac arrest might consider having
							an AED at home. Talk to your healthcare professional about whether you should buy an AED for
							your home.</p>
							<h3>When is an AED needed?</h3>
							<p>An AED is used to revive someone from sudden cardiac arrest. This usually happens when a
							problem in the heart's electrical activity causes a dangerously irregular heartbeat. The irregular
							heartbeat prevents the heart from pumping as it should and causes the heart to stop.<br><br>
							When this happens, the brain and other organs don't get the blood and oxygen they need.
							Treatment is needed within minutes to prevent death. The sooner the heartbeat is restored, the
							greater the chance there won't be permanent damage to the brain and other organs.<br><br>
							All AEDs include instructions on when and how to use them. Training on proper use of an AED
							is recommended. But someone with no training also can use the device to reset the heartbeat of a
							person who has had a sudden cardiac arrest. Using the AED could possibly save a life.<br><br>
							Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac arrest can keep blood flowing to the heart and
							brain for a time. But often only defibrillation can restore the heartbeat. Together these treatments
							can improve the chances of survival.</p>
							<h3>How to use an AED</h3>
							<p>If someone has fainted or collapsed and an AED is available:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li>Check to see if the person is breathing and has a pulse.</li>
							  <li>If you cannot feel a pulse and the person is not breathing, call for emergency
							  help. If you're alone, call 911 or emergency services first to make sure help is on the
							  way. If another person is present, one person can call 911 while the other prepares the
							  AED. If other people can help, one person can begin CPR while the AED is being
							  prepared.</li>
							  <li>Turn on the AED. The AED gives step-by-step voice instructions. It tells you how to
							  check for breathing and a pulse. It tells you how and where to place the AED pads on
							  the person's bare chest.</li>
							  <li>Stand clear and deliver the shock. When the pads are in place, do not touch the
							  person while the AED measures the person's heartbeat. If the machine thinks a shock
							  is needed, it tells the user to stand back and push a button to deliver the shock. Make
							  sure you or no one else is touching the person. Say "stand clear" loudly, and push the
							  shock button. The AED only delivers a shock when needed.</li>
							  <li>Start CPR. Begin CPR after the shock is delivered if CPR is still needed. The AED
							  will also guide users through CPR. The process can be repeated as needed until
							  emergency medical teams take over.</li>
							</ul>

						<button class="accordion title" id="AirwayAndIntubationAssistance">Airway Management & Intubation Assistance</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<h3>What Is the Purpose of Intubation?</h3>
							<p>Intubation is a relatively common procedure that’s performed on patients who can’t maintain
							their airway, patients who can’t breathe without assistance, or a combination of both.</p>
							<p>Common reasons for intubation:</p>
							<ol>
							  <li> The patient will undergo general anesthesia.</li>
							  <li> The patient suffers from respiratory failure. There are various reasons why a patient
							  may be too ill to breathe on their own:
							  <ul>
							    <li> They may have suffered an injury to their lungs.</li>
							    <li> They might have severe pneumonia.</li>
							    <li> They may have a breathing problem, like chronic obstructive
							    pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>
							  </ul>
							  </li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Intubation Prep</h3>
							<p>Preparation can greatly vary from one situation to the next. If you’re facing a difficult airway,
							you will likely perform an “awake intubation.” This is because a detailed airway examination is
							time-consuming and often not feasible during an emergency. Using a simple 1-2-3 rule for
							airway examination will allow you to detect potential airway difficulty in a minute or less.<br>
							<br>When possible, however, psychological preparation is always best for the patient. Do your best
							to explain the procedure in basic terms. Sedatives can also be used to provide comfort without
							compromising airway patency. According to NCBI, other types of preparation may include
							“anaesthetizing the airway through topical application of local anesthetics and appropriate nerve
							blocks.”</p>
							<h3>Intubation Steps</h3>
							<p>Here are some of the general guidelines you should follow when intubating a patient in a
							controlled setting:</p>
							<ol>
							  <li> Before intubation, the patient is usually sedated or not conscious, allowing their
							  mouth and airway to relax. They often lie on their back, while the healthcare
							  professional stands near the top of the bed, facing the patient’s feet.</li>
							  <li> The patient’s mouth is gently opened. Using an instrument to flatten the tongue
							  and illuminate the throat, the tube is steered into the throat and advanced into the
							  airway.</li>
							  <li> A small balloon around the tube is inflated to keep the tube in place and prevent
							  air from escaping. Once this balloon is inflated, the tube must be tied or taped in
							  place at the mouth.</li>
							  <li> Successful placement is checked by listening to the lungs with a stethoscope and
							  can be further verified through a chest X-ray.
							  <ul>
							    <li> If faced with a problematic airway, call for the difficult airway cart
							    and ask experienced colleagues to help.</li>
							    <li> Note: Preoxygenation and monitoring during awake intubation is
							    important.</li>
							  </ul>
							  </li>
							  <li> The tube is much easier to remove than to place. First, remove the ties or tape
							  that hold it in place. Then, deflate the balloon so that the tube can be carefully pulled
							  out.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Nasal Intubation</h3>
							<p>In some cases, the breathing tube is placed in the nose rather than the mouth. This is called nasal
							intubation. It’s performed if the mouth or throat has been injured or requires an operation. During
							this procedure, the nasotracheal tube (NT) goes into the nose, down the back of the throat, and
							into the upper airway.<br><br>
							This type of intubation is far less common, though, as it’s easier to intubate using the larger
							mouth opening. It also isn’t necessary in most scenarios.</p>
							<h3>Pediatric Intubation</h3>
							<p>While the size of the equipment is smaller, the actual process of intubation is often the same for
							adults and older children. However, it’s important to remember that a child requires a smaller
							tube than an adult. The procedure will also require a higher degree of precision since their airway
							is also smaller.<br><br>
							Nasal intubation is preferred for neonates and infants. In addition, there are different steps to
							follow in order to prepare a child for surgery.</p>
							<h3>Necessary Equipment for Intubation</h3>
							<p>The suggested supplies for endotracheal intubation include the following:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li> Laryngoscope: A metal or plastic device with a handle and curved blade attached to
							  a light. It’s inserted into the top of the throat to visualize the epiglottis.</li>
							  <li> Endotracheal tube: A thin, flexible tube outfitted with an inflatable balloon (cuff)
							  that is placed inside the airway.</li>
							  <li> Stylet: A slender and pliable rod or wire that is placed inside the tube to make
							  insertion easier.</li>
							  <li> Syringe: This instrument is used to inflate the balloon within the tube.</li>
							  <li> Suction catheter: A tube to suction out secretions and prevent aspiration.</li>
							  <li> Carbon dioxide detector: A device that’s used to check the position of the tracheal
							  tube by measuring exhaled carbon dioxide.</li>
							  <li> Oral airway: A device that conforms to the shape of the tongue and is placed inside
							  the mouth to maintain a clear airway.</li>
							  <li> Nasal airway: A device that keeps the nasopharyngeal airway clear.</li>
							  <li> Bag-valve-mask: A mask used for preoxygenation, which is the administration of
							  oxygen to a patient prior to intubation. This is done to extend ‘the safe apnoea time.’</li>
							  <li> Nasal cannula: A tube with two prongs that fit into the nostrils, which provides
							  additional oxygen.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Tips for Mastering Intubation</h3>
							<p>Many of our pro intubation tips involve technique, knowing your instruments, and handling
							difficult-to-intubate cases. Here are a few pro intubation tips that may assist you in the future.</p>
							<ul>
							  <li> Your initial goal is to find the epiglottis. If you insert the blade extremely slowly
							  into the mouth (about 1 cm at a time), the progression will be tongue, tongue, tongue,
							  tongue, tongue, tip of the epiglottis. This intentionally slow blade insertion technique
							  gives you the best opportunity to slip the blade into the vallecula.</li>
							  <li> If you only see pink mush, that’s not the tongue and you need to pull back.
							  Everyone knows what the tongue looks like, and the epiglottis is obviously the
							  epiglottis. So, the only mushy thing in there is the esophagus (and technically the
							  posterior pharynx).</li>
							  <li> If you pass the epiglottis, you’re either looking at the trachea, or you’ve snuck the
							  tip of the blade into the esophagus. Keep in mind that, once you lift the esophagus, it
							  opens up as big as the trachea and looks similar to a trachea without vocal cords.</li>
							  <li> When using a Miller (i.e. straight) blade, if the tongue is moving in your view, shift
							  the blade slightly to the right of the tongue’s midline. This will pop the tongue over to
							  your left and keep it out of the way.</li>
							  <li> With the Macintosh blade, get the mouth to open wide and insert the blade on the
							  far-right side of the mouth. Then, turn the handle of the blade 90 degrees so that the
							  handle is nearly pointing toward the left ear. Advance to just about the depth of the
							  epiglottis and rotate back to the normal position (perpendicular to the teeth and
							  pointing toward the far corner of the room).</li>
							  <li> How to confirm you’re in the trachea during emergencies or loud environments:
							  The solution lies with capnography. As soon as you place a tube in the trachea,
							  carbon dioxide will stream from the tube with every exhalation. If you have a
							  quantitative capnometer, you’ll promptly receive a CO2 level in the 30s or 40s. If you
							  have a qualitative capnometer, it will switch from purple to yellow the instant you’re
							  in the trachea, but be extremely careful.</li>
							  <li> The key to ventilating is to use the c-clamp technique you’ve seen in class, but
							  make sure you pull the chin up and into the mask. Don’t press the mask down on the
							  face. Hook the chin with one of your fingers and squeeze it up into the mask. Try to
							  put your pinkie on the angle of their jaw and pull up.</li>
							  <li> If you perform each of these tips and still can’t see the vocal cords, your patient is
							  likely a “hard tube.” You need to ask someone else to intubate them or try another
							  rescue airway.</li>
							</ul>

						<button class="accordion title" id="OxygenTherapy">Oxygen Therapy & Administration</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p>Oxygen therapy is a medical treatment that involves providing supplemental oxygen to patients
							who are experiencing hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen levels. This therapy helps improve
							oxygenation in the blood, thereby ensuring that vital organs and tissues receive sufficient oxygen
							to function properly. It is commonly used in conditions such as <b>chronic obstructive pulmonary
							disease (COPD), pneumonia, asthma exacerbations, heart failure, and during surgical
							recovery.</b> Oxygen therapy can be delivered through various devices, including nasal cannulas,
							face masks, and mechanical ventilators, depending on the patient’s needs and the severity of their
							condition.</p>
							<h3>The primary goals of oxygen therapy are to:</h3>
							<ul>
							  <li><b>Increase arterial oxygen levels</b>. Ensuring sufficient oxygen levels in the blood helps
							  maintain adequate tissue oxygenation and prevent hypoxia.</li>
							  <li><b>Reduce the work of breathing</b>. By providing supplemental oxygen, the therapy eases
							  the effort required by the respiratory muscles, allowing for more comfortable and
							  efficient breathing.</li>
							  <li><b>Decrease the workload on the heart</b>. Enhanced oxygen delivery reduces the strain on
							  the heart, particularly beneficial in patients with cardiac conditions, as the heart does not
							  have to pump as hard to circulate oxygenated blood.</li>
							  <li><b>Alleviate symptoms of hypoxemia, such as shortness of breath and fatigue</b>.
							  Improving blood oxygen levels helps relieve symptoms associated with low oxygen,
							  enhancing patient comfort and overall quality of life.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Devices Used in Oxygen Therapy</h3>
							<p>Oxygen therapy utilizes various devices to deliver supplemental oxygen to patients, tailored to
							their specific needs. Low-flow systems, such as nasal cannulas and face masks, provide oxygen
							in lower concentrations and are ideal for patients requiring modest increases in oxygen levels.
							High-flow systems, including Venturi masks and high-flow nasal cannulas, deliver precise and
							higher concentrations of oxygen, making them suitable for patients with more severe respiratory
							issues. Each device plays a crucial role in ensuring effective oxygen delivery and patient
							<a href="https://nurseslabs.com/providing-evening-care-to-patients/">comfort</a>. Understanding the distinctions between these systems helps in selecting the appropriate
							therapy for optimal <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/nursing-theories/">patient outcomes</a> Here are the common types of oxygen therapy devices,
							including their usage:</p>
							<h3>Low-Flow Systems</h3>
							<p>Low-flow systems deliver oxygen through narrow-bore tubing. Devices used for low-flow
							oxygen administration include nasal cannulas, face masks, oxygen tents, and transtracheal
							catheters.</p>
							<ol>
							  <li><b>Nasal Cannula</b>. A nasal cannula consists of a thin tube with two small prongs that are
							  inserted into the <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/respiratory-system/">nostrils</a>. This low-flow device is comfortable and convenient for patients
							  who need a small to moderate amount of supplemental oxygen (up to 6 liters per minute).
							  It allows for easy <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/impaired-physical-mobility/">mobility</a> and <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/nursing-management-guide-to-organizing-staffing-scheduling-directing-delegation/">communication</a>, making it suitable for long-term oxygen
							  therapy in patients with chronic conditions like COPD.</li>
							  <li><b>Face Mask</b>. Face masks cover the nose and <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/digestive-system/">mouth</a>, delivering oxygen through a mask
							  that fits snugly over the face. Face masks provide higher oxygen concentrations than nasal
							  cannulas (up to 10 liters per minute). They are used for patients who require moderate to
							  high oxygen levels or who cannot tolerate nasal cannulas. Different types of face masks
							  include simple face masks, partial rebreather masks, and non-rebreather masks, each
							  offering varying levels of FiO2.</li>
							  <li><b>Face Tent</b>. Face tents can be used as an alternative to oxygen masks when masks are
							  poorly tolerated by patients. They deliver varying concentrations of oxygen, typically
							  ranging from 30% to 50% at flow rates of 4 to 8 L/min. Regularly check the patient’s
							  facial skin for signs of dampness or chafing, and address any issues by drying and treating
							  the skin as necessary. As with face masks, it is important to keep the patient’s facial skin
							  dry to avoid irritation.</li>
							  <li><b>Partial Rebreather Mask</b>. A face mask with an attached reservoir bag that captures
							  exhaled gases. Provides higher oxygen concentrations (60-90% FiO2) by allowing the
							  patient to re-inhale some of the exhaled oxygen-rich air. It is used for patients needing
							  higher oxygen levels without a significant increase in CO2 retention.</li>
							  <li><b>Oxygen Tent</b>. Oxygen tents are large, transparent enclosures that surround the patient’s
							  bed. Oxygen tents are often used for pediatric patients who require a controlled oxygen
							  environment. They provide a humidified oxygen-rich atmosphere, which is beneficial for
							  children with respiratory infections or other conditions needing supplemental oxygen
							  without the discomfort of wearing a mask.</li>
							  <li><b>Transtracheal <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/intravenous-iv-therapy-technique/">Catheter</a></b>. Transtracheal catheters are small tubes inserted directly into
							  the <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/respiratory-system/">trachea</a> through a surgically created opening. This device delivers oxygen directly into
							  the trachea, allowing for efficient oxygenation at lower flow rates compared to other
							  methods. It is suitable for patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy, particularly those
							  who do not tolerate nasal cannulas or masks well.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>High-Flow Systems</h3>
							<p>High-flow systems provide all the necessary oxygen for ventilation in exact amounts,
							independent of the patient’s breathing pattern. Devices that deliver a precise and consistent
							fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) include the Venturi mask with large-bore tubing, the
							non-rebreather mask, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and mechanical ventilators.</p>
							<ol>
							  <li><b> Venturi Mask</b>. The Venturi mask is a high-flow device with large-bore tubing that
							  delivers precise and consistent concentrations of oxygen. The Venturi mask is ideal for
							  patients who require a specific and stable FiO2, such as those with COPD. It works by
							  mixing oxygen with room air through adjustable entrainment ports, providing accurate
							  oxygen delivery regardless of the patient’s respiratory pattern.</li>
							  <li><b> Non-Rebreather Mask</b>. A face mask with a reservoir bag and one-way valves to
							  prevent rebreathing exhaled air. Delivers the highest oxygen concentration available with
							  face masks (up to 100% FiO2) at flow rates of 10-15 liters per minute. It is used in
							  emergency situations or for patients with severe hypoxemia.</li>
							  <li><b> High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)</b>. A nasal cannula that delivers a high flow of
							  warmed and humidified oxygen. Provides precise and high concentrations of oxygen (up
							  to 100% FiO2) while maintaining comfort and allowing for better tolerance than

							<h3>Steps in Administering Oxygen by Cannula, Face Mask, or Face Tent</h3>
							<p>Here are the steps for administering oxygen using a cannula, face mask, or face tent:</p>
							<h3>Assessment</h3>
							<p>The following are the steps for assessing the administration of oxygen using a cannula, face
							mask, or face tent:</p>
							<ol>
							  <li><b>Assess patient’s skin and mucous membrane color.</b><br>
							  Evaluating the color of the skin and mucous membranes helps identify signs of cyanosis, which
							  indicates inadequate oxygenation. The presence of mucus or sputum production can provide
							  insight into respiratory conditions like infection or <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/">chronic bronchitis</a>. Impairment of airflow,
							  suggested by changes in color or sputum characteristics, can signal obstructive issues or the need
							  for further intervention.</li>
							  <li> <b>Assess patient’s breathing patterns.</b><br>
							  Monitoring the depth and rate of respirations, as well as abnormal patterns such as tachypnea
							  (rapid breathing), bradypnea (slow breathing), or orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying
							  flat), helps assess the severity of respiratory distress and the effectiveness of oxygen therapy.
							  These patterns provide clues about the underlying respiratory or cardiac conditions and guide
							  adjustments in treatment.</li>
							  <li> <b>Assess patient’s chest movements.</b><br>
							  Observing chest movements and looking for retractions (intercostal, substernal, suprasternal,
							  supraclavicular, or tracheal) during breathing can indicate respiratory distress or compromised
							  lung function. Retractions suggest increased work of breathing or <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/ineffective-airway-clearance/">irway obstruction</a> and may
							  require prompt intervention.</li>
							  <li><b> Assess patient’s chest wall configuration.</b>
							  Identifying abnormalities in chest wall configuration, such as kyphosis (abnormal curvature of
							  the spine), barrel chest (increased anteroposterior diameter), or unequal chest expansion, helps
							  assess the impact of chronic respiratory conditions or deformities on lung function. These
							  observations assist in <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/nursing-process/">planning</a> appropriate interventions and monitoring progression.</li>
							  <li><b> Auscultate patient’s lung sounds.</b><br>
							  Auscultating the lungs provides information about the presence of abnormal sounds such as
							  wheezing, crackles, or decreased breath sounds, which can indicate conditions like asthma,
							  pneumonia, or pleural effusion. Early detection of abnormal lung sounds helps guide treatment
							  adjustments and interventions.</li>
							  <li><b> Assess presence of clinical signs of hypoxemia.</b><br>
							  Monitoring for signs of hypoxemia (such as tachycardia, tachypnea, restlessness, <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/ineffective-breathing-pattern/">dyspnea</a>,
							  cyanosis, and <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/acute-confusion/">confusion</a>) helps gauge the severity of oxygen deprivation. Early signs like
							  tachycardia and tachypnea suggest mild to moderate hypoxemia, while confusion indicates
							  severe oxygen deprivation requiring immediate intervention.</li>
							  <li><b> Assess presence of clinical signs of hypercarbia (<a href="https://nurseslabs.com/impaired-gas-exchange/">hypercapnia</a>).</b><br>
							  Observing signs of hypercarbia (e.g., restlessness, <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/hypertension/">hypertension</a>, headache, <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/fatigue/">lethargy</a>, tremor)
							  helps identify elevated carbon dioxide levels, which can occur in conditions like COPD.
							  Recognizing these signs is crucial for adjusting oxygen therapy to prevent respiratory acidosis
							  and ensure proper <a href="https://nurseslabs.com/ineffective-breathing-pattern/">gas exchange</a>.</li>
							  <li><b> Monitor patient’s vital signs.</b><br>
							  Regularly monitoring vital signs, especially pulse rate and quality, along with respiratory rate,
							  rhythm, and depth, provides essential information about the patient’s overall cardiovascular and
							  respiratory status. Changes in vital signs can indicate deterioration or improvement and help
							  guide further treatment decisions.</li>
							  <li><b> Determine whether the patient has COPD.</b><br>
							  In COPD patients, a high carbon dioxide level may be the primary stimulus for breathing rather
							  than low oxygen levels. Monitoring arterial blood gas levels (PaO2 and PaCO2) is crucial to
							  prevent oxygen-induced hypercapnia, which can lead to respiratory complications.
							  <li><b> Determine results of diagnostic studies.</b><br>
							  Reviewing diagnostic studies such as chest x-rays provides detailed information about lung
							  pathology, including conditions like pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. These
							  findings help in tailoring the oxygen therapy and overall treatment plan.</li>
							  <li><b> Determine patient’s hemoglobin, hematocrit, and complete blood count.</b><br>
							  Assessing these blood parameters helps evaluate the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and
							  detect anemia or polycythemia, which can affect oxygen delivery and tissue perfusion.</li>
							  <li><b> Determine patient’s oxygen saturation levels.</b><br>
							  Measuring oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) with a pulse oximeter provides real-time
							  information on the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and helps ensure that the patient is receiving
							  adequate oxygenation.</li>
							  <li><b> Determine patient’s arterial blood gas levels.</b><br>
							  Analyzing arterial blood gases (ABGs) provides comprehensive information on the patient’s
							  acid-base balance, oxygenation, and ventilation status. This data is critical for fine-tuning oxygen
							  therapy and addressing any underlying respiratory or metabolic imbalances.</li>
							  <li><b> Determine patient’s pulmonary function tests.</b><br>
							  Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) assess lung volumes, capacities, and flow rates, offering insight
							  into the patient’s respiratory status and potential underlying conditions. These tests help guide
							  long-term management and evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing therapy.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Implementation</h3>
							<p>The following are vital measures for administering oxygen therapy with a cannula, face mask, or
							face tent:</p>
							<ol>
							<li><b>Determine the need for oxygen therapy, and verify the order for the therapy.</b><br>
							Assessing the need for oxygen therapy involves evaluating clinical indicators such as oxygen
							saturation levels, respiratory rate, and signs of hypoxemia (e.g., cyanosis, dyspnea). This is
							crucial because oxygen therapy is only warranted when there is a documented deficiency in
							oxygen levels or impaired respiratory function. Proper assessment ensures that the therapy is
							applied appropriately, preventing unnecessary treatment or delays in addressing oxygenation
							needs. Verifying the physician’s order ensures that the oxygen therapy is administered according
							to the prescribed flow rate, method, and duration. This step is essential for ensuring accuracy and
							consistency in treatment. It also helps avoid errors in oxygen delivery, which can lead to
							complications such as over-oxygenation or insufficient oxygenation. Confirming the order
							ensures that the therapy aligns with the patient’s specific clinical needs and treatment plan.
							</li>
							<li> <b>Prepare the patient and support people. </b><br>
							Preparing the patient and support people involves explaining the purpose and process of oxygen
							therapy, addressing any concerns, and ensuring they understand how to support the patient. This
							preparation helps reduce anxiety, enhances cooperation, and ensures that everyone is informed
							about the necessary procedures and precautions.
							</li>
							<li><b>Assist patient to a semi-Fowler’s position if possible. </b><br>
							Positioning the patient in a semi-Fowler’s position (sitting at an angle between 30 and 45
							degrees) can facilitate optimal lung expansion and improve ventilation. This position helps
							reduce the pressure on the diaphragm and allows for better oxygenation of the blood.
							Additionally, it can aid in the comfort of the patient and reduce the risk of complications such as
							aspiration.
							</li>
							<li> <b>Before initiating oxygen therapy, introduce self and confirm the patient’s identity
							according to the agency’s protocol. </b><br>
							This ensures that the correct patient receives the therapy, enhancing patient safety and
							compliance with protocols.
							</li>
							<li><b> Provide a clear explanation of the procedure, including its purpose and necessity, and
							inform the patient about how they can be involved. Additionally, discuss how the results of
							the oxygen therapy will guide future care decisions or treatments.</b><br>
							This helps the patient understand the intervention, which can alleviate anxiety and improve their
							cooperation. This also involves the patient in their treatment plan, making them more engaged
							and providing clarity on how the therapy outcomes will influence ongoing care decisions.
							</li>
							<li><b> Perform hand hygiene and observe other appropriate infection prevention procedures.</b><br>
							Hand hygiene is crucial for preventing the spread of infections and maintaining a sterile
							environment. Proper handwashing or use of hand sanitizer reduces the risk of transmitting
							pathogens. Adhering to infection prevention measures ensures that all protocols are followed to
							minimize the risk of infections and maintain patient safety and hygiene throughout the
							procedure.
							</li>
							<li><b>Ensure patient privacy is maintained, when applicable.</b><br>
							Maintaining patient privacy respects the patient’s dignity and confidentiality, which is essential
							for building trust and ensuring a comfortable and safe environment. It also complies with legal
							and ethical standards for patient care.</li>
							<li><b>Set up the oxygen equipment and the humidifier by following these steps:</b><br>
							<ol>
								<li><b>Connect the flow meter to the wall outlet or oxygen tank, ensuring it is in
							the off position initially.</b><br>
							Attaching the flow meter in the off position prevents accidental oxygen flow during
							setup, ensuring safety and accuracy when adjusting the flow rate.
							<li><b> If required, fill the humidifier bottle, preferably before approaching the
							patient.</b><br>
							Filling the humidifier bottle before bedside streamlines the process and minimizes
							disruption or delays in patient care.
							</li>
							<li><b>Securely attach the humidifier bottle to the base of the flow meter.</b><br>
							Connecting the humidifier bottle properly ensures that the oxygen delivered is
							adequately moisturized, improving patient comfort and preventing dryness in the
							airways.

							oxygen delivery system, allowing for effective and accurate administration of oxygen
							therapy.
							</li>
							</ol></li>
							<li><b>Turn on the oxygen at the prescribed rate and verify its proper functioning by
							performing the following checks:</b>
							<ol>
							<li><b>Ensure oxygen flow. Check that oxygen is flowing freely through the
							tubing, making sure there are no kinks and that all connections are airtight.</b><br>
							Verifying that the oxygen flows freely and that the tubing is unobstructed ensures
							that the patient receives the correct amount of oxygen. Airtight connections and lack
							of kinks prevent leaks or interruptions in therapy.
							</li>
							<li><b>Observe bubbles in the humidifier as the oxygen flows through.</b><br>

									mouth, delivering oxygen while allowing for some ambient air mixing. This is
									beneficial for patients who cannot tolerate a mask or have facial injuries.</li>
									<li><b>Secure the ties around the head.</b><br>
									Tying the tent securely ensures that it remains in the correct position, which helps
									maintain consistent oxygen delivery and prevents it from shifting, which could lead to
									ineffective treatment.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<li><b>Assess patient regularly.</b><br>
							Regular assessment of the patient is essential during oxygen therapy to ensure the treatment is
							effective and well-tolerated. Monitoring vital signs, anxiety levels, color, and ease of respiration
							helps evaluate the immediate response to the therapy and address any issues promptly, such as
							complaints of claustrophobia. Frequent assessments, typically every 15 to 30 minutes depending
							on the patient’s condition, allow for timely adjustments and interventions based on the patient’s
							evolving needs. Regular evaluations for clinical signs of hypoxia, tachycardia, confusion,
							dyspnea, restlessness, and cyanosis help detect any complications early and ensure the therapy is
							achieving its intended effect. Reviewing oxygen saturation or arterial blood gas results provides
							a quantitative measure of oxygenation, guiding adjustments to the therapy and ensuring optimal
							patient outcomes.</li>
							<h3><i>Nasal Cannula</i></h3>
							<ol><ul>
							<li><b>Regularly check the patient’s nostrils for any encrustations or irritation
							caused by the cannula. Applying a water-soluble lubricant can help soothe the
							mucous membranes and prevent discomfort or damage from prolonged use.</b><br>
							Assessing the nares ensures that the mucous membranes remain healthy and that any
							potential irritation is addressed promptly, which helps maintain patient comfort and
							adherence to the therapy. Applying lubricant reduces the risk of dryness and
							encrustation, which can cause discomfort and compromise the effectiveness of
							oxygen delivery.
							<li><b>Examine the tops of the patient’s ears for signs of irritation or pressure from
							the cannula tubing. Padding with a gauze pad can alleviate discomfort and
							prevent skin breakdown, especially with extended use.</b><br>
							Evaluating the ears identifies and addresses any discomfort or potential pressure
							sores caused by the cannula tubing, improving overall patient comfort. Padding the
							ears prevents skin irritation and pressure ulcers, which can be particularly problematic
							with long-term use of the cannula, thus ensuring sustained comfort and adherence to
							therapy.
							</ul>
							</ol></li>

							<b>Remember the steps of bleeding control with this acronym: ABC.</b>
							<p>After ensuring you're not in immediate danger, the first step is to call 911 to request emergency
							services.</p>
							<b>Bleeding assessment.</b>
							<p>When emergency services are on the way to provide advanced medical care, you should assess
							the bleeding. Locate the source of the bleeding by looking for injuries causing blood pooling.
							Clothing can affect the bleeding, so ensure you identify the wound's location on the body.</p>
							<b>Control the bleeding.</b>
							<p>After you find the source of the bleeding, applying pressure is the simplest, yet most effective,
							technique to slow it. You can use your hand to apply direct, firm pressure or cover the wound
							with any available cloth, like a shirt or towel and apply pressure to that. Push hard and maintain
							the pressure for a minimum of 20 minutes or until emergency services arrive.</p>
							<p>The injured person may feel pain or discomfort from the pressure applied to the wound. Tell the
							person that the pressure level is necessary to slow the life-threatening bleeding.</p>
							<p>For severe wounds, applying pressure may not be enough to control bleeding. If the wound is
							large, pack it with any available cloth to help decrease bleeding. For packing material, use
							clothing or towels; they don't need to be sterile or new. Any potential risk of infection from the
							packing material can be treated with antibiotics. The first priority is to stop the bleeding
							immediately.</p>
							<p>A tourniquet is a valuable tool when applied appropriately and correctly, especially if the source
							of bleeding is on an extremity, such as an arm or leg. Tourniquets are now more available and
							easier to use, even allowing people to apply a tourniquet to themselves.</p>
							<p>Applying a tourniquet requires training to ensure proper placement and tightness to control
							bleeding. Once a tourniquet is applied, do not remove it even if bleeding slows or stops.
							Releasing the tourniquet may allow the bleeding to resume. It's vital for medical professionals,
							like emergency department staff, to assess the bleeding before releasing the tourniquet.</p>
