                  <h2>Troubleshooting Common IV Complications</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Infiltration</b> occurs when IV fluid leaks into the surrounding tissue, causing swelling, cool skin, pallor, and pain. If
                      this happens, stop the infusion immediately, elevate the limb, apply a warm compress, and restart the IV in a
                      different site.</li>
                    <li><b>Phlebitis</b> is inflammation of the vein, usually indicated by redness, warmth, pain, and swelling along the vein.
                      Treatment involves stopping the IV, applying a warm compress, and restarting the IV in a new site.</li>
                    <li><b>Extravasation</b> happens when a vesicant drug leaks into the tissue, leading to severe pain, redness, and possible
                      blistering. The IV infusion should be stopped immediately, the drug should be aspirated if possible, and an
                      antidote should be administered if available. The site should be monitored for tissue damage.</li>
                    <li><b>Infection</b> at the IV site presents as redness, warmth, pus formation, and fever. If infection is suspected, the IV
                      should be removed, a culture of the site should be obtained, and antibiotics should be administered as
                      necessary.</li>
                    <li><b>Air Embolism</b> can occur if air enters the bloodstream, causing sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and a drop
                      in blood pressure. If suspected, the IV should be clamped, the patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg
                      position, and oxygen should be administered while notifying the physician.</li>
                  <li><b>Occlusion</b> is when the IV line becomes blocked, leading to slow or stopped IV flow and resistance when flushing.
                    To address this, the tubing should be checked for kinks, and a gentle flush should be attempted. If resistance
                    persists, the IV line should not be forced, and an alternative site should be considered.</li>

										<h2>D. Z-Track Method</h2>
										<h3>Definition:</h3>
										<p>The <b>Z-track technique</b> is a variation of the intramuscular injection method used to prevent medication from leaking into
											the subcutaneous tissue, commonly used for irritating or staining medications (e.g., iron dextran).</p>

										<h3>Procedure:</h3>
										<ol>
											<li> Verify the physician’s order and check the 10 Rights of Medication Administration.</li></li>
											<li> Perform hand hygiene and prepare the medication.</li>
											<li> Select the ventrogluteal or vastus lateralis site, avoiding the deltoid.</li>
											<li> Clean the injection site with an antiseptic wipe and allow it to dry.</li>
											<li> Pull the skin laterally (about 1-1.</li>5 inches) to displace the tissue.</li>
											<li> Insert the needle at a 90° angle into the muscle.</li>
											<li> Aspirate if required, then inject the medication slowly.</li>
											<li> Wait 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle to allow the medication to settle.</li>
											<li> Withdraw the needle quickly and release the displaced skin immediately to seal the track.</li>
											<li> Do not massage the area to prevent medication from leaking into the subcutaneous tissue.</li>

										<h2>E. Aspiration and Non-Aspiration Techniques</h2>

										<h3>Aspiration Technique:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li> Aspiration refers to pulling back the plunger before injecting medication to check for blood return, which
											indicates if the needle is in a blood vessel.</li>

											<li> It is traditionally performed for intramuscular injections in larger muscles (gluteal sites).</li>
											<li> Current practice varies, and aspiration is often not required for deltoid and vastus lateralis injections.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Non-Aspiration Technique:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li> Many guidelines suggest not aspirating when administering vaccines or medications in non-high-risk areas like
											the deltoid.</li>
											<li> For subcutaneous and intradermal injections, aspiration is not needed.</li>
											<li> The Z-track method does not require aspiration in most cases.</li>
										</ul>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>When to Aspirate and When Not To:</h2>

										<h3>Aspirate for:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li> Intramuscular injections in the dorsogluteal and ventrogluteal sites (some protocols still recommend it).</li>
											<li> Injectable medications that require confirmation of muscle placement (e.g., certain antibiotics or oil-based</li>
											medications).
										</ul>
										<h3>Do NOT aspirate for:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Subcutaneous and intradermal injections.</li>
											<li>Intramuscular injections in the deltoid and vastus lateralis.</li>
											<li>Vaccines, insulin, heparin, and anticoagulants.</li>
